Referring to supervisor to address as below

For this application to proceed, you must:

1. Identify your supervisory team and select your supervisor contributions, adhering to one of the plans in this document (see points 42 and 43; https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/about-us/about-the-university/policy-hub/research-innovation/doctoral-study/supervising/doctoral-supervision-policy-procedures.html). Note that in most cases you are required to have at least one SBS-based supervisor to ensure a member of your team is familiar with our university processes.

Maybe:
Nick Matzke, Main/Co/Co 60/20/20
Main: Nick Matzke
Co: Shane Wright, biogeography expertise, co-investigator on funding Rutherford grant
Co: Tanya Renner (international), carnivorous plants expert (probably she would agree)



2. Provide three additional provisional goals. These should not to too hard/too easy and if possible, should have a quantifiable element. These goals are used as useful stop/go points to judge a student's ability to continue into our PhD program. Please do not include a literature review/substantial writing as this is already included as a compulsory goal. A quantifiable goal that might use could be ‘successfully extract DNA and amplify the bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences from 50 soil samples’.

I think, provisional goals for the first year:

* Attend, or make plans to attend, an international evolution or biogeography meeting.

* Provide, to the approval of the advisor, worked-out examples of key techniques to be used in the thesis, with illustrations generated by R code, covering key techniques to be used. Many will be covered by a few sentences which demonstrate understanding.  These include: 

- Likelihood, log-likelihood, Maximum Likelihood, Likelihood Ratio test and AIC/AICc/BIC and statistical model comparison with same, Markov models for discrete characters, SSE models, biogeography models, comparison of log-likelihood and RSS (residual sum of squares) in linear regression, explanation of linear regression as an ML technique. 
- Explanation and uses of different kinds of graphs: scatter plots, histograms, bar charts, box plots, violin plots, PCA or NMMDS plots. 
- Phylogeny objects in R, and how to manipulate them. 
- Perform basic bioinformatics tasks in R and command-line Terminal (relabeling sequences in FASTA files, generating alignments, trimming alignments, etc.)
- Use of IQtree and Beast2 on a basic sequence dataset.
(I request this goal, as I have discovered that if this basic knowledge is not locked down very strongly early-on, everything else becomes much harder later.)

* Assembly of a geography dataset for carnivorous plant biogeography (Masafumi has already made the phylogeny)




3. You must complete and upload a supervisor statement. If your student is applying for UoADS, this should be uploaded well in advance of the application deadline.

4. You must confirm that you have sighted at least two reference reports for your student. As these can take some time to be uploaded it is advised that you ask your student to request that their referees cc you into their emails submitting their reports to applications and admissions. Note that referee reports are not required for students whose qualifying program (Hons or MSc) was at UoAuckland.

- N/A

5. If your student will primarily based off-site (e.g. at a CRI) then you must complete an off-campus form.

- N/A

6. If you wish to supervise the student, please complete these tasks and then refer the student application back to the Department Graduate Advisor (DGA, Paul Harris) for further processing

Attend, or make plans to attend, an international evolution or biogeography meeting


This goal aligns with my commitment to staying updated with the latest advancements in evolution or biogeography fields.

Relevant to this, collaboration and networking are important. Many biases/ critics in the evolution field, and I want to have diverse perspectives + answering skills

- NEW: Data management and version control?


(I request this goal, as I have discovered that if this basic knowledge is not locked down very strongly early on, everything else becomes much harder later.)


I have learnt some basic bioinformatics (IQtrees, Beast2 from BIO700) + biodata analysis throughout assignments last year, but only a few were used in practice/thesis, so I agree with the importance of solidifying my understanding of key techniques early on. In addition to these, I want to make sure I have strong data management and version control this year. Managing and tracking data changes, especially coding would be essential for PhD and future research (with huge datasets). I learned version control (Github) in BIO738, but I want to ensure this as well. 





3. Assembly of a geography dataset for carnivorous plant biogeography (Masafumi has already made the phylogeny)


I understand this is the starting point, is important. Getting paleogeographic and paleoclimate to test with evolving traits, so that we can see which influences the LDD ability of carnivorous plants.
